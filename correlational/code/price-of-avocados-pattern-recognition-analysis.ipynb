    "<h3> A Note to my fellow Kagglers: </h3>\n",
    "As in previous projects, I start to publish my kernels from the beginning. Why? well I am always open to feedback from the community and it makes it more interesting for me to receive feedback from the community while I am working on this project. This explains my methodology of publishing my projects before they are done. Nevertheless, updates will come throughout the following months but remember I am still balancing my time due to school, external projects and other extra-curricular activites. I will try to make interesting updates as I learn more in detail everything with regards to time series forecasting using R. I am new in this topic especially when it comes to using R as my tool for analysis. I am excited to share all the things I learn with regards to time series forecasting with the community. Thanks to the community for always providing me with support and positive feedback. Let's begin!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this kernel I will explore everyhting related to time series forecasting using R. I will be updating this kernel as time goes by because I want to learn as much as possible how the time series libraries work using R and to know all its component. This project will be extensive but really useful fr the community to learn about all the different parametersthat compose the time series forecasting. I hope you enjoy this journey no one said it was going to be easy but the hard work will reward both the community and myself. Wait for further updates! <br><br>\n",

Now what is the main goal of autocorrelation? We would like to see if there is a linear relationship from the first lag (month). So we would like to see if there are certain patterns as opposed to the first month. The correlation at lag zero is always one because it correlated to itself. At lag one, we see that the correlation is <b> close to one </b>, this tells us that the correlation to the first month (lag 0) is similar, so the trend is highly correlated with month 1 (January).  </li>\n",

    "Autocorrelations helps us determine if there are certain patterns in our data. So what is the main purpose of using Autocorrelations and how could it help us determine certain patterns in our time series dataset? First thing, the word \"Auto\" gives us a hint that we are planning to use an internal correlation. What does internal correlation mean? We basically are taking a specific date (in the example below we use January) and we want to see whether the price of avocados have some sort of correlation with the price of January. In the first visualization, lags are a representation of months. So we can see that the correlation is higher the closer the month is from January/ This means that the price of February are similar to the avocado prices of January. As the months pass by, the correlation as opposed to the month of January gets lower indicating to us that there are no specific patterns to the month of January. Price movements in those months except for February and March do not have highly correlated prices compared to the prices of January.\n",

    "    <li><b>Average Method: </b> This is just the average line of the last three years that we are analyzing. These years are 2015, 2016 and 2017. This will give us a fix value however, this value is important. When we talk about technical analysis, whenever prices go below the average line we are \"expected\" to see a downward trend. </li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Naive Method: </b> Is just setting all forecast values to the last value we saw. You can see that the blue line is at the same level of the last price in December. That explain why it is so low! Since the avocado price was so low for both conventional and organic avocados, this could have a similar functionality to a support line. If we see prices going below this line, it could indicate a new downward trend.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Seasonal Naive Method:</b> This will equal to the last value of the past year. So for instance if we are using monthly data, our forecast in january will be equivalent to the last January value of the year of 2018. </li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Drift Method: </b> This will better detect the pattern of prices since it will use the average change of the historical data as a point of reference when it comes to forecasting. It is most likely, that this forecast will understand the trend however, it will ignore any seasonality patterns. </li>\n",

    "<a id=\"conclusion\"></a>\n",
    "When it comes to to the analysis we have implemented there are several observations we have observed:<br>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><b>Expensive Organic Avocados:</b> As expected, we have noticed that organic avocados are much more expensive than conventional avocados. </li>\n",
    "    <li><b> Similar patterns by type: </b> There are some distinguishable patterns between the two types of avocados however, we see that most patterns are similar between these two types of avocados. </li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Year 2017: </b> The year of 2017 was the best year of avocados. One of the factors that could have contributed was the well being of the economy as a whole but there could also be other hidden factors that could affect avocado prices in the market. </li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Volatility: </b> Although, 2017 was the year with the highest prices, it was also the year with the highest volatility. This means that price fluctuations were higher in this year as oppose to the past two years. </li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Buy avocados before fall!: </b> We see a consistent pattern of avocado prices increasing when fall is coming. This applies to both conventional and organic avocados. </li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Downward trend in the longrun: </b> Based on our ARIMA model, for both types of avocados we expect a downward trend in prices at least in the longrun. There could be some upward pressure in the short run however, our model predicts that both avocado prices will o downwards 2 years from now. </li>\n",
